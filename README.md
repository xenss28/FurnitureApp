# FurnitureApp

This is a project that i make while im on my 4th semester in college. 
Why i called it furniture app because we are told to make a furniture app using SQL, database, and many more. 
Basically, this was a e-commerce app for furniture only. I haven't finished this app because im running out of time.
These are the features that i havent finished:
1. Chat box -> This feature is useful to make users to be able to chat with the store owner. 
2. Google Maps -> Why we use google maps because we want to locate buyer's location
3. Transaction History -> You will be able to see your recent transaction history. This page contains your order's and the price of the item.
